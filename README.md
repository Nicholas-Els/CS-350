Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The basic fundamentals for this project was to make a thermostat that would turn the heat on whenever the temperature was below the set temperature.

What did you do particularly well?
I did particularly well with completing the provided code to produce the required information. I might be new to coding, but in the end, I produced the required information to showcase the thermostat working.

Where could you improve?
Since most of the code was provided to us, I want to improve by furthering my own knowledge of how they came to the result of the provided code.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
To complete this project, I researched any problem I encountered. I knew that I wasn't going to be the first to ask the question, all I had to do was to find the answer. I will be adding this research approach to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The only skill that I will transferring is all lessons I learned from my failures. You learn more from failures than you do from successes. With this in mind, while researching for my problems, I also encountered other problems that I didn't consider. This allowed me to get a better image of what the problem I was having was. Bringing this mindset to other projects will allow me to figure out any future problems faster.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Since most of the code was provided, I just went through there and tried to label everything that wasn't labeled once I figured out what the code in that section was saying. The code that wasn't provided, I tried to label in the simplest terms that I could think of. This ensured that anyone reading this could understand what I meant.
